# weekly-readings
The goal here is to create a web app that dynamically changes the contents of the reading blocks to this weeks current readings. I have 2 objects in main.js (readingPlan, for the 3 year reading plan; torahPortions, for the Torah reading). I would prefer to have these objects in separate json files, but I can't figure out how to get everything to function correctly using json. 

As far as I can tell, the Haftarah and Brit Chadashah portions are different every year, and I can't find a list. So, I can't automate those unless I create my own list, or am able to find one that has the same readings we use. Until then, I will have to update those 2 fields manually every week.
