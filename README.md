# weekly-readings
**The goal**
Have a web app that dynamically changes the contents of the reading blocks to this weeks current readings. I have 2 objects in main.js (readingPlan, for the 3 year reading plan; torahPortions, for the Torah, Haftarah, and Brit Chadashah readings). I would prefer to have these objects in separate json files, but I can't figure out how to get everything to function correctly using json. 

**Note**
I will have to update my startDate variables every year until I create variebles/functions to convert the Gregorian calendar to the Hebrew calendar.
